I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, advised by Professor Hae-Won Park. Prior to that, I received an M.Sc from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, advised by Professor Jun-Ho Oh. My work lies on dealing with legged robots, with a focus on state estimation, contact implicit trajectory optimization, model predictive control, Lie group theory, and reinforcement learning.
