	We introduce Contrastive Intrinsic Control (CIC), an algorithm for unsupervised
	skill discovery that maximizes the mutual information between statetransitions
	and latent skill vectors. CIC utilizes contrastive learning between 
	state-transitions and skills to learn behavior embeddings and maximizes
	the entropy of these embeddings as an intrinsic reward to encourage behavioral
	diversity. We evaluate our algorithm on the Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning
	Benchmark, which consists of a long reward-free pre-training phase followed by
	a short adaptation phase to downstream tasks with extrinsic rewards. CIC
	substantially improves over prior methods in terms of adaptation efficiency,
	outperforming prior unsupervised skill discovery methods by 1.79X and the next
	leading overall exploration algorithm by 1.18X.
