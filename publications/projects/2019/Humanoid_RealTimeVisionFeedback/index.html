	This paper introduces an obstacle-avoiding algorithm for bipedal robots,
	especially in push recovery situations. Typically, There are many algorithms
	that plan footstep to avoid obstacles based on vision recognition data.
	However, if the robot is pushed, the planned footprint will change, and thus,
	there is no guarantee that it will avoid obstacles. Although modified stepping
	positions can be limited, the robot's stability is not assured. Our proposed
	algorithm focuses on avoiding obstacles through vision recognition in push recovery
	situations and generating compensation actions for instability by restricting modified
	footsteps. We fuse vision feedback with our previous push recovery algorithm, which
	optimizes the ankle, hip, and stepping strategies. We build simple grid data using
	vision recognition and apply it to the inequality constraint of the stepping position.
	We validate the effectiveness of our algorithm using the bipedal platform GAZELLE
	with the Kinect V2 RGBD sensor.
