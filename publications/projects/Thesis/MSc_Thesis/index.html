	The problem of navigating a bipedal robot to a desired destination in various environments is very important.
	However, it is very difficult to solve the navigation problem in real time because the computation time is very long
	due to the nature of the biped robot having a high degree of freedom. In order to overcome this, many scientists
	suggested navigation through the footstep planning. Usually footstep planning use the shortest distance or angles
	as the objective function based on the A * algorithm. Recently, the energy required for human walking, which is
	widely used in human dynamics, approximated by a polynomial function is proposed as a better cost function that
	explains the bipedal robotâ€™s movement. In addition, for the real time navigation, using the action set of the A *
	algorithm not fixed, but the number changing according to the situation, so that the computation time does not
	increase much and the methods of considering the collision with the external environment are suggested as a
	practical method. In this thesis, polynomial function approximating the energy required for human walking is
	adopted as a cost function, and heuristic function considering the angular difference between the robot and the
	destination which is not shown in the previous studies is newly proposed and proved. In addition, a new method to
	integrate the adaptive behavior set and energy related to human walking is proposed. Furthermore, efficient
	collision avoidance method and a method to reduce the local minimum problem is proposed in this framework.
	Finally, footstep planning algorithm with all of these features into the mapping algorithm and the walking algorithm
	to solve the navigation problem is validated with simulation and real robot.
