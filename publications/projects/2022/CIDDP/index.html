	In this work, we propose a novel differential
	dynamic programming (DDP) framework for systems involving
	contact with the ground. The approach converts a general
	constrained differential dynamic programming into contact-
	implicit one by incorporating contact dynamics in a linear
	complementarity problem (LCP) formulation. Analytical gra-
	dients of the contact dynamics are obtained through a relaxed
	complementarity condition in the LCP formulation that helps
	the search directions of optimization avoid stalling in bad local
	minima or saddle points. Incorporation of contact dynamics and
	its analytical gradients into DDP enables an online discovery
	of not only dynamically-feasible trajectories of states, control
	inputs, and contact forces but also contact mode sequences.
	We demonstrate that our Contact-Implicit Differential Dynamic
	Programming framework successfully finds totally new dynamic
	motions with contact mode sequences in a variety of robotic
	systems including an one-legged hopping robot and planar
	quadrupedal robot in simulation environment.
