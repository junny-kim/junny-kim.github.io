	In this work, a non-gaited framework for legged
	system locomotion is presented. The approach decouples the
	gait sequence optimization by considering the problem as
	a decision-making process. The redefined contact sequence
	problem is solved by utilizing a Monte Carlo Tree Search
	(MCTS) algorithm that exploits optimization-based simulations
	to evaluate the best search direction. The proposed scheme
	has proven to have a good trade-off between exploration and
	exploitation of the search space compared to the state-of-
	the-art Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP). The
	model predictive control (MPC) utilizes the gait generated by
	the MCTS to optimize the ground reaction forces and future
	footholds position. The simulation results, performed on a
	quadruped robot, showed that the proposed framework could
	generate known periodic gait and adapt the contact sequence
	to the encountered conditions, including external forces and
	terrain with unknown and variable properties. When tested on
	robots with different layouts, the system has also shown its
	reliability.
