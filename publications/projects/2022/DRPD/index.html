	This paper presents a reduction mechanism for
	robot actuators that can switch between two types of reduction
	ratio. By fixing the carrier or ring gear of the proposed actuator
	which is based on the 3K compound planetary drive, the
	actuator can shift its reduction ratio. For compact design with
	reduced weight of the actuator, unique pawl brake mecha-
	nism interacting with cams and micro servos for switching
	mechanism is designed. The resulting prototype module has
	a reduction ratio of 6.91 and 44.93 for ‘low-reduction’ and
	‘high-reduction’ ratios, respectively. Reduction ratios can be
	easily adjusted by modifying the pitch diameters of gears.
	Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed actuator
	could extend its operation region via two reduction modes that
	are interchangeable with gear shifting.
